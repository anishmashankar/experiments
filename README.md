#Anish Mashankar's Experiments
Hello,
This repository consists of all the files that I have used in performing my experiments on my blog. All the code that is present here is well documented through comments and also wiki pages.
##How to surf through the repository?
All the files that I have posted here are categorized based on the programming language that I have used to create them.<br>
For example, all files that I have written in python are posted in the python folder.<br>
The files that relate to a specific project on data analysis are present in a separate folder. The title of the folder tells about what data is analyzed, or from where I have taken the project. The data analysis project folders consist of code files that were used to wrangle, and analyze that data. Such files are mostly written by me in Python or R.
