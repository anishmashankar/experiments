#Python
All the projects that I have written in Python are stored here. The readme will tell you about what each file contains.

###crawler.py (beta)
A simple web crawler that starts from a seed and browses for all the .html documents. I have designed this web crawler to search for only my blog. You might modify some of the parameters in such way to use this code for your own purposes:
'seed' stores the starting point of the crawl. The crawl begins from this link.

###sentana.py
A simple sentiment analysis tool following the Naive Bayes Classification algorithm using the NLTK library for Python. The movie-reviews corpus data set of NLTK is used for advanced training for this experiment. More information on the blog post.
